# Synth Samples SDL2
I've been wanting to get into audio coding ever since university but there never seemed to be the right time. Last year though I managed to scrape together some of the basics, and thinking back I would really have liked to have some good sample code to start off with. So the goal of this series is to try to produce really good samples for someone wanting to get into audio coding. They will be improved continuously, feedback and suggestions are welcome.
